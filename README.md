# BlogCity
 BlogCity is a web-app made by using the django framework of python along with bootstrap 4 and jQuery for the frontend! A few changes need to be made on the front-end and are currently under way
 PS - I've used a follow-along tutorial for the creation of this blog-app from CoreySchrafer. More projects on the way!
